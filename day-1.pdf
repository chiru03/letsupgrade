Blockchain:-
         Its an emerging technology where it can overcomes the problems that we are facing with our early days technology.
		 blockchain involves a series of blocks.in which each blocks contains:-
		 
		 1.Block number
		 2.transaction records
		 3.SHA hash of the previous block
		 4.mining key
		 
		 Its a peer-to-peer based network that once the we writes its really impossible to makes changes...

Blockchain technology can  overcomes with:-
          1.authentication issues
		  2.security issues
		  3.need of dependance on a middle man to verify our transaction records.

 The features that block chain provides us are:-
          1.security
		  2.tamper proof of transaction records
		  3.verifiability
		  4.immutable 
		  5.Unchangable

The block contains:-
        1.block number
		2.transaction  records
		3.unique SHA hash of previous record
		4.mining key
		
5.
Verifiability of blockchain can be attained by:
   Since it is  a combination disturbted database and cryptography ,the same balocks  of data are transfered and maintained by many servers or computers
   if any change in the individual records it changes the subsequent blocks data but not in others shared data.....
